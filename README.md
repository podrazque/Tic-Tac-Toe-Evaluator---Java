# Tic-Tac-Toe-Evaluator---Java
This is my first ever project I did in Java. A tic tac toe board evaluator, also the first time I used JUnit Test Suite.

There's nothing complicated going on here, I tried to make the code less lines than it was because my friend challenged me to see how low I can get the number. I quickly realized it was a dumb idea since the code was becoming less readable but I never bothered to fix it. Although all of the bad styling mistakes I made are fixed in the C++ version of this project.
